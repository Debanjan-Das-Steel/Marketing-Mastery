A project about customer personality analysis and customer interests
The project is about the visualization of a dataset of Customer
Personality Analysis available on Kaggle. I did the project on a R
Markdown file, with cleaning the data and making ggplots of some
important values like education vs income of the customers and then
concluded what could be done in campaigns to attract more
customers.
